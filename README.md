Hi, I’m @spinolio (aka Esteban). I’m interested in:
- Cycling
- Microcontroller programming
- Linux

I’m currently learning:
- Go
- Rust
- Python

I’m looking to collaborate on any projects using C/C++, Python, Perl, Go. Particularly interesting in projects that have math/science connections
or radio control.
